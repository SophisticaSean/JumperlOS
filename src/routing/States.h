This is the new target YAML format for the states system

everything is optional, it'll default to the config values

make sure it's easy to add new fields in the future

Example YAML format:
version: 2

bridges:
  - {n1: 1, n2: 5, dup: 2}
  - {n1: 10, n2: 20, dup: 3}

nets:  # optional, for colors/names
  - {num: 6, name: "Signal A", color: 0xFF0000, nodes: [1, 5]}
  - {num: 7, name: "Signal B", nodes: [10, 20]}

power:
  topRail: 5.0
  bottomRail: 0.0
  dac0: 3.33
  dac1: 0.0

config:
  routing: {stackPaths: 2, stackRails: 3, stackDacs: 0, railPriority: 1}

//                           # is legal on either half
//       placed: false       # runtime flag; always serialized
//       placement: compact  # expanded (default, OMITTED) | compact | custom
//       pins:
//         GND:  {pin: 1, connect: GND, class: gnd}
//         TRIG: {pin: 2, connect: 7, class: signal}
//         A:    {offset: 0, connect: 45}
//
// PLACEMENT MODES (guide-UX design §2, PartPlacement.cpp partPinNode()):
// `expanded` (0, the default) puts every leg at its footprint row and lets
// expandOnePart() route a bridge from there to the pin's `connect:` node.
// `compact` (1) is how you would breadboard it by hand - a leg whose
// `connect:` is a PHYSICAL HOLE ROW (1-60, TOP_RAIL, BOTTOM_RAIL) goes
// straight into that hole and emits NO bridge, because the leg itself is the
// connection. Per-pin, not all-or-nothing: a leg whose endpoint is
// fabric-only (GND=100 has no holes; DAC/ADC/GPIO likewise), `class: nc`, or
// absent keeps its footprint row and its bridge. ICs never compact (their
// legs ARE the footprint) - a hand-written `placement: compact` on a DIP is
// normalized back to expanded on parse, with a warning. `custom` (2) is
// expanded geometry from a row: the user moved by hand; the marker exists so
// a future re-provision does not snap it back. Unknown values parse as
// expanded with a warning. Emitted only when non-default (the verify/color
// precedent), so pre-wave-2 files are byte-identical after a rewrite - and
// note the converse: an OLDER firmware opening a new file DROPS `placement:`
// silently (unknown keys are skipped by design), so the part comes back
// expanded.
//
// PIN FORMS PARSED: both the nested block form above (one `NAME: {...}` per
// line under `pins:`) and the inline one-line form
// `pins: {A: {pin: 1, connect: 7}, B: {pin: 2}}`. Part entries themselves
// parse in block form only (`- name: ...`). `pin:` is the 1-based physical
// pin number placed by the DIP/SIP footprint math; `offset:` places the pin
// at baseRow+offset on the same side and WINS over `pin:` when >= 0.
// `offset:` IS EXPANDED-MODE GEOMETRY ONLY - it names a footprint row, so a
// compact-eligible pin ignores it (the leg goes to `connect:` instead) and it
// is what a non-eligible pin falls back to. It also predates `axial2`, which
// makes most historical uses obsolete: the old way to straddle the ravine was
// a sip2 with `{offset: 0}` / `{offset: 30}` (which does not even parse -
// offsets may not cross the ravine), so a 2-leg part should now declare
// `footprint: axial2` and plain `pin: 1` / `pin: 2`. Offsets are still the
// right tool for a leg that sits at a fixed distance from pin 1 on a strip
// with gaps. An offset that lands off-board (or on the far half) now REJECTS
// THE WHOLE PART, exactly like an oversized DIP/SIP span - see partGeometryOk
// in PartPlacement.cpp; before wave 2 such a part was accepted and then
// placed partially, which is the same silent-partial-loss class.
// `connect:` is node-only - a row number 1-60 or any node name resolvable by
// parseNodeName(), the exact helper `bridges:` parsing uses. `class:` is
// signal|power|gnd|nc (default signal). Unknown keys inside a part entry are
// skipped without error; malformed part entries are skipped with a warning,
// like bridges. A pin name may not begin with '-' or '#': pin names are
// emitted UNQUOTED as `      <NAME>: {...}`, so "- X" would reload as a
// parts-LIST entry (every following pin misattributed to a phantom part) and
// "#X" as a comment. parsePinEntry refuses it on every path (YAML and
// place_part alike, with a parse warning); jl_place_part carries a matched
// second copy so the two predicates cannot drift.
// (Section-keyword names like `overlays` used to be dangerous too, because
// the overlays pass strstr-scanned the whole file; it now matches only an
// UN-INDENTED `overlays:` line and stops at the next un-indented header, so
// a part/pin/value carrying the word is harmless.)
//
// guideProgress round-trips as ONE top-level flow-map line - the only shape
// parsed and the only shape emitted (keep serializer and parser matched):
//   guideProgress: {source: "/projects/555/wiring.yaml", step: 3, of: 5, skipped: 0x4}
// Emitted only while guideSource is non-empty. `meta:` and `guide:` sections
// are swallowed on parse and NOT round-tripped - the launcher and the guide
// runtime re-read the project file themselves.
//
// `of:` is the STEP TOTAL the guide had when it last persisted progress, and
// it is emitted only when non-zero (the runSource rule: an unemitted scalar
// would be destroyed by the next idle auto-save, so serializer and parser
// land in the same commit - they do). It exists because the SINGLE-RUN-FILE
// launcher has to answer "is a guided build MID-FLIGHT in this file?" from
// the FILE ALONE, before anything is loaded: numSteps cannot be recomputed
// launcher-side, since guideParse resolves `part:` names (and synthesizes
// auto steps) against the LIVE parts table, which at that moment still holds
// the previous context. step < of means unfinished. A file with no `of:`
// (hand-written, or written before this field existed) reads as total 0 =
// "unknown", and the launcher then treats it as NOT mid-flight - it reopens
// silently and the existing resume gates do the right thing anyway.
// SlotManager::scanGuideProgressFile() is the load-free reader; it lives
// beside the parse arm in States.cpp so the two cannot drift.
//
// `skipped:` is the SKIP SET as a hex bitmask, bit i = step i was deliberately
// skipped. It exists because `step:` is guideFirstUnfinished, which treats a
// skipped step as finished - so a skip always lands strictly BELOW the resume
// cursor and the resume loop cannot otherwise tell it from a commit. That
// mattered most for `power_on`: promoting a skipped one to committed made INIT
// re-energize the rails under the banner promising 0 V. Emitted only when the
// writer actually KNOWS the skip set (the guide runtime persisting a live
// session), never speculatively - so a hand-written file, or one written
// before this key existed, round-trips byte-identically and reads back as
// "skip set unknown" rather than as a false "nothing was skipped". An unknown
// skip set is the one case in which resume REFUSES to re-apply power. Older
// firmware reading a new file ignores the key: parseGuideProgressLine only
// looks up the keys it knows, and the `,`/`}`-bounded value scan for `step:`
// and `of:` is unaffected by a trailing key.
//
// `guide:` FORMAT NOTES (parsed by guiding/GuidedFlow.cpp, documented in
// CodeDocs/DESIGN_GUIDED_PLACEMENT.md §2/§5 - listed here because this is
// the file the section shares):
//   - a rail_sane step with an explicit `target:` is checked as VCC-class,
//     i.e. "within 0.2 V of the top rail". The format cannot say which class
//     a single named row is, so one band has to be the default and VCC is
//     the useful one; GND-class rows are what the classless form finds by
//     itself from the parts' own `class: gnd` pins. For an explicit "this
//     row should be at 0 V" check, use `check: voltage` with
//     min: -0.15 / max: 0.15.
//   - CONTINUITY `min:`/`max:` ARE OHMS (wave 2). They used to be milliamps,
//     because the check compared a raw INA current against an authored
//     current band; it now measures RESISTANCE four-wire (the sense legs ride
//     the stimulus chain, the shunt sits on the ground side) and divides, so
//     an authored bound names ohms. `value:` + the optional per-part `tol:`
//     (percent) derive the band on their own - tol_author (default 15) +
//     tol_meas (5 / 10 / 25 by decade) - and explicit min/max still WIN when
//     they are given. Two guards catch a file still carrying the old numbers:
//     a band that does not BRACKET the parsed `value:`, or (for a value-less
//     part) a `max:` under 5 ohms, logs "min/max look like legacy mA" and
//     falls back to the derived band. VF/VOLTAGE/OSCILLATES min/max are
//     unchanged (volts / volts / Hz).
//   - `enforce: false` on a CONTINUITY or VF step waives the band verdict
//     only: the check still runs, still prints what it measured, and still
//     FAILS on the verdicts that mean a placement mistake rather than a value
//     mistake - open, short (<5 ohm), and vf's no-current (missing/backwards).
//     It is for a project whose `value:`s are a suggestion; the reading lands
//     in the part's measuredOhms (RAM only, list_parts()['measured']) so a
//     companion script can compute from the components actually placed. On any
//     other check kind the field is a parse warning and is ignored - there
//     min/max IS the author's own intent and there is nothing to waive.
//   - ONE STEP IS ONE `- {...}` FLOW MAP. Block style (`- id: x` on one line,
//     `  do: place` on the next) is NOT parsed: each field line falls through
//     to the guide-level key arm, which ends the steps: list, so the step
//     AFTER it is dropped. That used to happen in silence - two authored
//     steps parsing as one - and now prints "guide step spans lines -
//     unsupported, next step may be lost". A flow map that merely WRAPS
//     (`- {do: place, part: U1,` / `   text: "..."}`) is fine: guideParse
//     joins continuation lines until the braces balance, bounded at 4 lines /
//     512 chars so an unclosed brace cannot swallow the file. `text:` must
//     still be the LAST field of the joined line.
//   - a `do: connect` step's `n1:`/`n2:` are LITERAL rows and do NOT
//     re-derive when a part moves. A part's OWN wiring does re-derive for
//     free (bridges are never stored per part - expandOnePart recomputes
//     partPinNode against `pin.connect` every time it applies), so route
//     part wiring through the parts' `pin.connect` fields wherever you can
//     and keep `connect:` steps for board-to-board jumpers. When a move
//     vacates a row a later `connect:` step names, the guide prints
//     `(note: step k targets row NN, which <part> just left)` - it cannot
//     fix the step, only tell you the file has gone stale.
//
// fromYAML INDENT-HARDENING: top-level section headers are recognized on
// UN-indented lines only (the serializer never indents them), so a nested
// key like `config:` inside a contained section can't hijack the section
// state. Exception: `fakeGpio:` is also recognized while inside `config:` -
// the serializer nests it there ("  fakeGpio:"). An unrecognized un-indented
// `something:` header opens an ignored/contained section instead of
// corrupting the one before it.
//
// ROUND-TRIP IS LOAD-BEARING: toYAML is a wholesale rewrite; any section the
// serializer doesn't emit is silently destroyed by the SlotManager idle
// auto-save. serializeParts() must re-emit every field deserializeParts()
// accepts.
