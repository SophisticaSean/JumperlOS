// showLEDsCore2 — cross-core "refresh the LEDs" request, decoded in core2stuff()
// (main.cpp). The integer is a packed command:
//   base mode (after stripping the modifiers below):
//     0 = idle / nothing requested
//     1 = show the netlist (showNets + measurements + row animations + overlays)
//     2 = menu/graphics text buffer only (flush b.print output; skip showNets)
//     3 = staged graphics: keep whatever is already in the buffer, skip showNets
//   modifiers:
//     negative  -> clear the breadboard (clearLEDsExceptRails) before composing,
//                  then process abs(value)  (e.g. -1 = clear + show nets)
//     +10       -> use a blocking show (showBBBlocking) instead of async DMA
//                  (e.g. 12 = blocking menu-buffer flush; see waitForBlockingDisplay)
// (Modes 4/5/6 were never produced by any writer and have been removed.)
//
// FOLLOW-UP (deep refactor, after the encoder/flush pass is verified on hardware):
// replace this packed magic-int with a typed request, e.g.
//   struct LedRefreshRequest { enum Mode { OFF, NETS, MENU, STAGED } mode;
//                              bool clear_bb; bool blocking; };
// and funnel all writers through one Core-2 compose function with a single show()
// call site, retiring the negative/+10 encoding. See also the encoder-source and
// dirty-flag follow-up notes in RotaryEncoder.cpp / LEDs.cpp.
// T2.2c: the packed int above is now core1req::REQ_SHOW_LEDS (CoreMailbox.h) -
// exactly the typed request the FOLLOW-UP note asked for, and it landed with
// the vocabulary intact: requestLedShow(1/2/3/-1/12/...) is the one writer.
// The mode REPLACES a pending one (postMode: last write wins, as the int did),
// the clear-first / blocking flags coalesce, core 1 takes the request in
